    <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux
      kernel, an operating system
      kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.</p>
    <p>Now Linux is more than just a kernel . And Linux market share is now bigger than unix and one thing to remember
      is that linux is founded by donations not by selling and most of the linux distribution aka linux os are
      communitty based.This all happend because Linus Torvalds moved towards open source</p>
